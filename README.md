-KP281 valued at 1500$ 
-KP481 valued at 1750$ 
-KP781 valued at 2500$. 

Customer data from the last three months was analyzed for customer profiling, which will help the market research team better understand customer needs and preferences when selecting AeroFit treadmills, leading to an improved recommendation system. Categorization of the client is done based on their gender, age, education, marital status, fitness level and income. Furthermore, their expectations on how many days they will use the treadmill and how many miles they are planning to walk/run is also recorded.

The correlation matrix represents what impact certain factors have on the selection of the final product. As can be seen from the following figure that age greatly impacts income meaning that with age income also increases. Similarly, education also has significant correlation with income. And most customers with high income (85k to 105k usd per annum) prefer KP781. High usage of the treadmill is also directly related to higher fitness, income and miles covered each week.
